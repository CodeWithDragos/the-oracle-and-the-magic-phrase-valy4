- Then I see a series of choices (prompts) with criterias for the phrase
- Then I chose what criterias I want the phrase to fulfill
    - do I like to do sports
    - do I like to make puzzles
    - do I like pets
    - do I like pizza
    - do I like to draw or to read
    - am I a morning person or a evening one
    - ........
- After I answer all prompts, I get a magic phrase that will predict my future as a developer.
- Use your imagination to finish the game.
